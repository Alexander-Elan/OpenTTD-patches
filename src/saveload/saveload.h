/*
 * An experimental savegame provides no backward or forward compatibility.
 * It can only be loaded by the same binary that produced it, or one from
 * the same sources; as a safeguard, the saveload code will refuse to load
 * an experimental savegame unless the binary itself is built with this
 * flag set.
 *
 * Experimental savegames should be used sparingly, because they contain
 * no information about their layout. They should be used when a change
 * in the savegame format is too invasive to be done atomically, i.e.,
 * when it must be split into smaller commits and many of them alter the
 * savegame format, so as not to bump the savegame version at each step
 * or to add lots of compatibility checks in the code. In this situation,
 * first increase SAVEGAME_VERSION and set savegame experimentality to
 * true, then all savegame-changing commits go in, and finally savegame
 * experimentality is restored to false. (This means, of course, that
 * savegames made with intermediate source trees will not load with any
 * other version.)
